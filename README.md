# Where it started
We’re a group of data aficionados from Purdue University who want to make it easier for researchers to create FAIR data.  Our areas of influence span from hands on work with researchers in the College of Agriculture to providing  RDM support services across campus and continuing to sustain and grow the Purdue University Research Repository.  We’re focused on the people producing data in higher education research.

# Challenges
* **Daunting goal**: it takes so long to turn data into great FAIR data ​
* **Unclear path**: no guidance on day-to-day decisions​
* **FAIR  for others**: making FAIR data is typically done at the end of the project, and doesn’t benefit the producer​
* **Producer inexperience**: majority of data is generated by graduate students just beginning their journey.​
* **Constant change**: turnover in data producers, coupled with changes in information collected and tools required

# Guiding principles
* FAIR throughout – Making data FAIR isn’t another step at the end, it’s part of the data production process.​
* FAIR for us – Most data is created on funded projects and FAIR data for a project leads to FAIR data for all.​
* People first – Data is created by individual researchers and giving them agency to act in best interest.

# What it takes
* **Process driven** – An approachable process that works throughout the data production process, providing customizable tools for surveying current conditions, assessing opportunities, recommending specific actions, and recognizing benefits.​
* **Measured progress** – A rubric guided  by the capability maturity model, supporting realistic expectations for the individual researcher, and reaffirming the value of their efforts through short term rewards to motivate researchers to continue through the long process of research data production.​
* **Collaborative framework** –  Guided by thoughtful data professionals, having conversations at key stages throughout the research process, and leveraging additional resources to bridge the gap between FAIR guidelines and active data production.
